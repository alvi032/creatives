            licensed by Company and protected by U.S. and international copyright, trademark, service mark, trade
            secret, patent and/or other proprietary rights and laws. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement,

            <span class="heading">6. FEES AND PAYMENTS</span>

            <span class="sub-heading">6.1</span> Fees.Subscriber shall pay Company for the Services provided by Company hereunder as specified in the
            applicable Order.<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">6.2</span> Payment Methods. At a time mutually agreeable to the Parties, Company agrees to submit invoices and/or
            accept payment by the following methods:
            Credit Card on file with Authorization (“CCA”)
            Prior to access of the Services, Subscriber will provide Company with a valid major credit card information
            including account number, expiration dates and CVV or other codes necessary to authorize a card not present
            transaction. Valid active card information shall be maintained at Company at all times during the Term.
            Company shall not be responsible for any in interruption, delay of cancellation of Services caused by an
            inactive or invalid credit card on file. If a Subscriber purchase order is required, the purchase order
            number will be included by Subscriber in the relevant Order. If no purchase order number is included in an
            Order, the parties agree such purchase order will not be required to effect payments thereunder.
            <br>
            <span class="sub-heading">6.3</span> Payment Terms. All pricing and payments are and shall be in U.S. dollars and will be charged by the

            the provision of the Services to Subscriber, excluding any withholding or export taxes or taxes based upon
            Company’s income. To the extent Company is required to collect such taxes under applicable Law, Company, to
            the extent legally or otherwise required, shall separately state the amount of tax due on its invoices to
            Subscriber. Subscriber and Company shall cooperate to segregate the fees into: (i) those for taxable
            Services and (ii) those for nontaxable Services. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other to
            more accurately determine each Party’s tax liability and to minimize such liability, to the extent legally
            permissible. In addition, Company shall provide and make available to Subscriber any information regarding
            the computation of any such taxes as reasonably requested by Subscriber. Company shall not pay any taxes
            based on the Services that Subscriber and Company disagree on as to whether a tax is due without affording
            Subscriber a reasonable amount of time after being called upon by the taxing authority to pay such tax to
            dispute the payment of such tax, at Subscriber’s expense, in the appropriate legal forum.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="heading">7. CONFIDENTIALITY</span>
            <br>
            <span class="sub-heading">7.1</span> Confidentiality. Each Party agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the other Party’s Confidential
            Information as defined herein. “Confidential Information” means all information concerning a Party’s
            business not generally known to the public, whether or not marked as confidential. By way of illustration
            only, Confidential Information may include this Agreement, trade secrets, know-how, inventions, contractual
            disclosures, techniques, processes, algorithms, software programs, schematics, software source documents,
            contracts, customer lists, financial information, sales and marketing plans, information and business plans
            and other proprietary information, whether or not such information is marked as confidential. Confidential
            Information shall not include, even if it is marked as such, information that: (i) is already known to the
            receiving Party at the time of disclosure, which knowledge the receiving Party shall have the burden of
            proving; (ii) is, or, through no act or failure to act of the receiving Party, becomes publicly known; (iii)
            is readily observable and / or duplicable by the public; (iv) is legally received by receiving Party from a
            third party without restriction on disclosure; (v) is independently developed by receiving Party without
            reference to the Confidential Information of the disclosing Party; or (vi) is approved for release by
            written authorization of the disclosing Party. In maintaining the confidentiality of the other Party’s
            Confidential Information, each Party shall use at least the same standard that Party uses for its own
            confidential information of similar type, and shall take necessary precautions not to disclose such
            information to any person except its officers, employees or subcontractors, who have a need to know in order
            to comply with the obligations of this Agreement. Each Party’s officers, employees, and subcontractors shall
            be bound by the terms of this Section or a similar written agreement with terms no less protective of either
            Party’s Confidential Information than this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that any actual or threatened
            violation of this Section may cause irreparable, non-monetary injury to the disclosing Party, the extent of
            which may be difficult to ascertain, and therefore agrees that the disclosing Party shall be entitled to
            seek injunctive relief in addition to all other remedies available at law and/or in equity. Nothing in this
            Section shall prohibit Company from disseminating aggregated information that contains no identifiable
            Subscriber Confidential Information.<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">7.2</span> Destruction and Return of Confidential Information. Upon request of the disclosing Party or upon
            termination of this Agreement, all materials containing Confidential Information will be destroyed or
            returned to the disclosing Party and the receiving Party will retain no copies or reproductions of the
            Confidential Information unless required by law, except the receiving Party may retain one record copy,
            subject to the reasonable instructions of the disclosing Party with respect to such copy.
            <span class="sub-heading"><br>
                7.3</span> Cooperation. In the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or loss of any Confidential Information
            of the disclosing Party, the receiving Party shall promptly, at its own expense: (i) notify the disclosing
            Party in writing; (ii) take such actions as may be necessary or reasonably requested by the disclosing Party
            to minimize the violation or the damage resulting therefrom; and (iii) cooperate in all reasonable respects
            with the disclosing Party to minimize the violation and any damage resulting therefrom.<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">7.4</span> Limitation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, Company may disclose Subscriber’s
            Confidential Information, which includes personally identifying information and End-user activity: (i) in
            accordance with a judicial or other governmental subpoena, warrant or order; provided that Company shall
            comply with any applicable protective order or equivalent and, unless prohibited by law, Company will employ
            commercially reasonable efforts to provide Subscriber with prior written notice, so that Subscriber has an
            opportunity to intervene at its own expense and to protect the confidentiality of its information; (ii) to
            law enforcement officials and regulators if it reasonably suspects unlawful activity; and (iii) to other
            Parties that are identified by Subscriber for that purpose.<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">7.5</span> No Intellectual Property. THE RECEIVING PARTY ACQUIRES NO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS FROM THE
            DISCLOSING PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, except for the restricted right to use disclosing Party’s
            Confidential Information for the express, limited purposes described above.

            <br>
            <span class="sub-heading">9.1</span> General Indemnities. Each Party shall defend, indemnify and hold the other Party and its Affiliates and
            their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors, successors, and assigns harmless from
            and against any and all damages, losses, fines, penalties, costs, and other amounts (including reasonable
            attorney’s fees and expenses) (collectively, “Losses”) arising from or in connection with any actual or
            threatened claims, demands, investigations, and causes of actions by third parties (each a “Claim”) to the
            extent such Claim is based on or arises from or relates to (i) any breach or default of any provision of
            this Agreement; or (ii) negligent or intentional acts or omissions caused by the other Party or its
            Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors, successors and assigns.

            written Notice of any Claim for which the indemnified Party is seeking or may seek indemnification hereunder
            (provided that the failure of the indemnified Party to promptly notify the indemnifying Party hereunder
            shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of any liability with respect to the Claim, except to the extent
            the indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of the Claim is prejudiced by such failure). The
            indemnified Party shall provide reasonable cooperation (at the indemnifying Party’s expense) and retain full
            authority to defend or settle the Claim. The indemnifying Party shall keep the indemnified Party fully
            informed concerning the status of any litigation, negotiations or settlements of any such Claim. The
            indemnified Party shall be entitled, at its own expense, to participate in any such litigation, negotiations
            and settlements with counsel of its own choosing. The indemnifying Party shall not have the right to settle
            any Claim if such settlement arises from or is part of any criminal action or proceeding, or contains a
            stipulation to, or an admission or acknowledgement of, any wrongdoing (whether in tort or otherwise) on the
            part of the indemnified Party without the prior written consent of such indemnified Party.

            <span class="heading">12. TERM AND TERMINATION</span>
            <br>
            <span class="sub-heading">12.1</span> Term. The initial term of this Agreement shall be as set forth in the applicable Order (“Initial Term”)
            and shall thereafter be renewed by the Parties for an additional term of the same length (“Subsequent Term”)
            unless either Party provides the other Party with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of
            termination or intention not to renew prior to the commencement of the next annual period. The Initial Term
            and Subsequent Term may collectively be referred to as the “Term”. The Company reserves the right to
            increase the list prices applicable to any Subsequent Term by an amount not to exceed five percent (5%) of
            the original list price set forth in the applicable Order.<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">12.2</span> Termination for Breach. Either Party may terminate the applicable Order hereunder upon written notice
            to the other Party if such other Party commits a material breach of this Agreement and does not cure such
            breach within 30 days following its receipt of Notice thereof from the terminating Party. No refunds shall
            be issued to Subscriber in the event that Subscriber commits a material breach of this Agreement. “Material
            breaches” include: (i) failure by Company to deliver the Services or Professional Services as agreed under
            this Agreement; (ii) any breach of Section 5 (Proprietary Information); (iii) any failure by Subscriber to

            <span class="sub-heading">12.3</span> Suspension of Services. Any unauthorized access, use of passwords or Services, or other abuse or
            impermissible activity on Company’s Site or in connection with Company’s Services may result in immediate
            suspension or termination of End-User accounts with no refund and without limitation of any other available
            legal remedies. Company may suspend Subscriber’s access to any Services until all overdue payments are paid
            in full. Delinquent invoices are subject to interest of one percent (1.0%) per month on any outstanding
            balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is less, plus all expenses of collection. Subscriber
            will continue to be charged for the remainder of the term for any delinquent accounts. Subscriber
            acknowledges and agrees that Company has no obligation to retain User Data and that such User Data, if any,
            may be irretrievably deleted upon termination of this Agreement. With respect to any Services provided by
            Company as an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partner on a third-party platform, Subscriber
            acknowledges that (i) Subscriber’s access to the Services may be suspended due to non-payment by Subscriber
            to such third-party platform through which Company Services are accessed or breach of Subscriber’s agreement
            with such third-party platform, and (ii) in the event such Subscriber’s relationship with the third-party
            platform through which Company Services are accessed is terminated as a result of non-payment or other
            material breach of such Subscriber’s agreement with the third-party platform, such Subscriber’s License to
            the portion of the Services provided in conjunction with the third-party platform would also be terminated.
            <br>
            <span class="sub-heading">12.4</span> Remedies Not Limiting. The remedies provided in this Section 12 are in no way limiting of one another
            or of any other rights and remedies granted to either Party under this Agreement. Company may choose to, but
            is not required to, place Subscriber’s account on suspension in lieu of termination where termination is
            permitted under the terms of this Agreement or take other appropriate action.

            <br>
            <span class="heading">13. MISCELLANEOUS</span>
            <br>
            <span class="sub-heading">13.1</span> Notices. Any demand, notice, or other communication required or permitted hereunder shall be effective

            other Party with notice of the change.<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">13.2</span> Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither Party shall assign or transfer this Agreement nor delegate any of
            its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent
            shall not be unreasonably withheld. However, either Party, upon written notice to the other Party, may
            assign this Agreement to the surviving entity in a merger or consolidation in which it participates or to a
            purchaser of all or substantially all of its assets provided that Subscriber shall have the right to
            immediately terminate this Agreement in the event that Company assigns this Agreement to any competitor of
            Subscriber. Any assignment, transfer or delegation of rights or obligations hereunder in contravention of
            this Section shall be null and void. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
            and be enforceable by the Parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns.<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">13.3</span> Dispute Resolution; Equitable Relief. The Parties agree that, in the event of a dispute or alleged
            breach, they shall first work together in good faith to resolve the matter internally through negotiations
            and, if necessary, by escalating it to higher levels of management. The foregoing shall not apply to, and
            shall not prevent a Party from seeking immediate relief in the event of, disputes involving the
            confidentiality or data protection provisions of this Agreement or infringement of intellectual property
            rights (in which case either Party shall be free to seek available remedies in a court of competent
            jurisdiction in accordance with the Governing Law Section of this Agreement).<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">13.4</span> Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding between the Parties
            with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
            representations, discussion, negotiations, letters, proposals agreements and understandings between the
            Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, whether written or oral. This Agreement may be
            amended, modified or supplemented only in a writing duly executed by an authorized representative of each of
            Subscriber and Company.<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">13.5</span> Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the
            State of Ohio, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. For any disputes that are not
            resolved by way of good faith negotiations and settlement, the Parties hereby consent to the exclusive venue
            and jurisdiction for actions concerning or relating to this Agreement in the federal or state courts of
            Columbus, Franklin County, Ohio.<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">13.6</span> Headings. The Section headings in this Agreement are for reference and convenience only and do not
            explain, modify, interpret, or expand the provisions of this Agreement.<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">13.7</span> Independent Contractors. In making and performing under this Agreement, the Parties are acting and
            shall act as independent contractors and not that of master and servant or partnership. Neither Party is,
            nor will be deemed to be, an agent, legal representative, joint venture, or partner of the other Party for
            any purpose. Neither Party shall have any authority to act for or to bind the other Party in any respect,
            nor shall either Party hold itself out as having such authority. Each Party agrees to assume complete
            responsibility for its own employees with regard to federal or state employer’s liability, worker’s
            compensation, social security, unemployment insurance, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration
            requirements, and other laws.<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">13.8</span> Severability. If any of the provisions of this Agreement are declared to be invalid or unenforceable by
            a court of competent jurisdiction, such provisions shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
            unenforceability while the other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect.<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">13.9</span> Waiver. No term or provision of this Agreement shall be deemed waived and no breach excused, unless
            such waiver or consent is in writing and signed on behalf of the Party against whom it is asserted. Any
            consent by any Party to, or waiver of, a breach of the other, whether express or implied, shall not
            constitute a consent to, waiver of, or excuse for any different or subsequent breach of this Agreement by
            such Party.<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">13.10</span> Survival. The provisions of this Agreement, which by their nature survive expiration or termination of
            this Agreement, shall survive, including, but not limited to the following Sections: 5 (Proprietary Rights),
            7 (Confidentiality), 8 (Representations and Warranties), 9 (Indemnities), and 10 (Limitation of Liability).<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">13.11</span> Controlling Document. Notwithstanding any inconsistent or additional terms and conditions which may be
            contained in a purchase order, invoice, voucher or other similar document issued by either Party, such
            document shall be for issuing Party’s internal purposes only and the terms and conditions of this Agreement
            shall prevail. Therefore, even if such document is acknowledged or accepted by the receiving Party and
            regardless of any statement to the contrary which may be contained therein, the inconsistent or additional
            terms and conditions of such purchase order, invoice, voucher or other similar document shall have no force
            or effect on this Agreement.<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">13.12</span> Interpretation; Construction. Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, (i)
            references to the plural include the singular, the singular the plural, the part the whole, (ii) references
            to any gender include all genders, (iii) “or” has the inclusive meaning frequently identified with the
            phrase “and/or,” (iv) “including” has the inclusive meaning frequently identified with the phrase “but not
            limited to,” and (v) references to “hereunder” or “herein” relate to this Agreement. The Parties agree that
            this Agreement is the result of careful negotiations between sophisticated Parties and thus any principle of
            construction or rule of law that provides that an agreement shall be construed against the drafter of the
            agreement in the event of any inconsistency or ambiguity in such agreement shall not apply to the terms and
            conditions of this Agreement.<br>
            <span class="sub-heading">13.13</span> Signature/Counterparts. The Order and this Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which
            shall be deemed to be an original, and both of which, taken together, shall constitute one agreement binding
            on both Parties. A facsimile signature or electronic signature (or e-signature) shall have the force and
            effect of an original signature, and in the absence of an original signature, shall constitute the original
            signature.
